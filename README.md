**Experiment Setup**

We believe that...
matchmaking by cuciocity lead to more meaningful connections, higher project completion and accountability between learners.

To verify that we will...
Create a basic clickable pototype application for learners in an existing learning network to use.

And measure...
No. of connections 
Student satisfaction with new connections
Project completion rate
Do student's attribute any of their project or learning success to the app

We are right if...
Students find more collaborators than before
If those connections are meaningful based on self reported curiocities
If the results of their work or learning increase
If student's attribute any of their project or learning success to the app
